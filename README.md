# DotNet-WebApp
The workflow is triggered on a push event to the main branch.
Job 1 builds, packages, and pushes the project's NuGet package(s) to GitHub Packages.
Job 2 waits for Job 1 to complete successfully and then downloads the NuGet package artifact generated by Job 1 to the specified directory.
This workflow automates the build, packaging, and distribution of a .NET Core project using GitHub Actions, allowing for continuous integration and deployment of the project.

# Job 1: Build and Package
Checkout: This step checks out the source code repository.
Restore Dependencies: It restores the NuGet packages and other dependencies required by the project using the dotnet restore command.
Build the app package: It builds the project using the dotnet build command with the specified configuration (in this case, Debug).
Generate .nupkg files: It generates NuGet packages for the project using the dotnet pack command and stores them in the AppPackages directory.
Upload build artifacts: It uploads the generated NuGet package(s) to GitHub Actions as artifacts, making them available for later use.
Publish to GitHub Packages: This step sets up the .NET Core environment for pushing packages to GitHub Packages.
Push package to GitHub Packages: It iterates through the generated NuGet packages and pushes them to GitHub Packages repository using the dotnet nuget push command.
# Job 2: Download Artifact
Runs-on: It runs on the same self-hosted environment as Job 1.
Needs: This job depends on Job 1, meaning it will only start after Job 1 has completed successfully.
Download artifact: It downloads the NuGet package artifact (WebApplication3.1.0.0.nupkg) generated by Job 1 from the workspace. The artifact is downloaded to the directory specified in the path parameter.
